### Titanic Dataset Analysis
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights about passenger survival.

#### Project Workflow
* Data Loading – Import dataset and inspect structure.

* Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, convert data types, and drop irrelevant columns.

* Exploratory Data Analysis – Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

* Data Visualization – Charts and graphs to visualize survival patterns by gender, class, age, etc.

* Correlation Analysis – Heatmap of numeric variables.

* Insights – Key findings on factors influencing survival.

#### Technologies Used
* Python (pandas, numpy)

* Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

* Jupyter Notebook for analysis

#### Dataset
The dataset contains details of Titanic passengers such as name, age, class, fare, and survival status.

#### Key Insights
1. Females had higher survival rates than males.

2. Higher-class passengers had better survival chances.

3. Younger passengers were more likely to survive.

4. Higher-class passengers had better survival chances.

5. Younger passengers were more likely to survive.
